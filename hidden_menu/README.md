If you are on slow internet or want to install any offline .zip Recovery Rom, you can install via 'Choose update package' menu.
But this menu is hidden by default. You have to activate or enable this menu by tap on the logo 7 times or
until the pop-up 'Additional update features are on' message appear. 
Then tap on the verticle 3 dots (kebab) icon and select "Choose update package" to continue your update task.
